# pokercalc
Simple command line program that would calculate the odds of certain poker outcomes based on the hand that the user has and the cards that are currently on the board. Currently a work in progress as most of the program works but there is some functionality I'm trying to clean up 

The end goal is to have a web application that would be able to do this, to act as an aide for beginner poker players or those playing online poker.
